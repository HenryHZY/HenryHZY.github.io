  <p>Hi, welcome to my personal website!</p> 
    
  <p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) majoring in Software Engineering. 
    And I expect to receive my B.E. degree at School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), SYSU in Jun. 2022.</p>

    <p>I am grateful to be supervised by Prof. <a href="http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2465">Chang-Dong Wang</a> in SCSE previously
        and enjoy conducting research on Data Mining and Deep Learning. 
        I also have a high research interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graph (KG). 
        Under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/">Yangqiu Song</a> in HKUST, Department of CSE, 
        I am excited to go on the next research adventure toward NLP and KG.
        As a person who is passionate about research, I wish to pursue a PhD degree in the future.</p>
    
  <p>Feel free to contact me or take my <a href="file/CV of Zi-Yuan Hu.pdf">CV</a> for further information. 
        You can also look me up on <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/HenryHZY">Zhihu (Chinese Quora)</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuan-hu-8a29751bb/">Linkedin</a> / <a href="https://github.com/HenryHZY">Github</a> / <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42479092">CSDN Blog</a>.
