  <p>Hi, welcome to my personal website!</p> 
    
  <p>I am a third-year undergraduate from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) majoring in Software Engineering. 
    Looking forward to working with people who are passionate about research, I am looking for a PhD position in Hong Kong starting 2022 FALL.
    </p>

    <p>Currently, my research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graph (KG), specifically commonsense reasoning and self-supervised learning.
        Under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/">Yangqiu Song</a> in HKUST and Prof. <a href="https://lemondan.github.io/">Xiaodan Liang</a> in SYSU,
        I am excited to go on the next research adventure toward NLP and KG. 
        I am also grateful to be supervised by Prof. <a href="http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2465">Chang-Dong Wang</a> in SYSU previously
        and enjoy conducting research on Data Mining and Deep Learning.</p> 
        <!-- As a person who is passionate about research, I wish to pursue a PhD degree in the future.-->
    
    <!-- <p> </p> -->

        <li> (Accepted) "A BP Neural Network Based Recommender Framework with Attention Mechanism" (accepted by TKDE 2020, IF=4.935, JCR Q1)

            <br>Chang-Dong Wang, Wu-Dong Xi, Ling Huang, Yin-Yu Zheng, <strong>Zi-Yuan Hu</strong> and Jian-Huang Lai 
            <ul><li> In this work, we proposed a novel recommendation framework based on Back Propagation (BP) neural network with attention mechanism, 
                namely BPAM++. Compared with DNNs, BPAM++ can not only reduce the computational and storage costs, 
                but also alleviate the over-fitting issues.</li>
                <li>[<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9199116">paper</a>][<a href="https://github.com/xiwd/BPAM">code</a>]</li>

        <li> (Preprint) "BCFNet: A Balanced Collaborative Filtering Network with Attention Mechanism"
            
            <br><strong>Zi-Yuan Hu</strong>, Jin Huang, Zhi-Hong Deng, Chang-Dong Wang, Ling Huang, JianHuang Lai and Philip S. Yu 
            <ul>
                <li> In this paper, we have presented a novel recommendation model called Balanced Collaborative Filtering Network (BCFNet), 
                    which combines attentive representation learning (BCFNet-rl), attentive matching function learning (BCFNet-ml) 
                    and balance module (BCFNet-bm). </li>
                <li> Under the balance strategy and pre-training strategy, the proposed BCFNet model can not only 
                    alleviate the over-fitting issue caused by the high sparsity of interaction information, 
                    but also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</li>
